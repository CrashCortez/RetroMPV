# RetroMPV - Contol MVP with Xboxdvr 

### This is the Gpi branch it is a complete fork of [GPi2](https://github.com/SinisterSpatula/Gpi2) from SinisterSpatula.

These xboxdrv controller scripts greatly enhance the capabilities of your RetroPie. They can provide many virtual buttons using a button as a modifier. It also helps by mapping controls to keyboard keys for emulators that lack the ability to interface with the RetroPie controls (some of the standalone non-libretro cores and programs).

## To install please refer to the [Master Branch](https://github.com/CrashCortez/RetroMPV)
