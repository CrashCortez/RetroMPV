# RetroMPV - Contol MVP with Xboxdvr 

### This is TEST branch is to add controller "support" for Playing videos from ES as if they were roms for non-Gpi retropie setups. This is not ready for release. do not try as of 2/7/2020 will update the page once I have tested it on a few pi with different controllers.

# Current Test PS3

These xboxdrv controller scripts greatly enhance the capabilities of your RetroPie. They can provide many virtual buttons using a button as a modifier. It also helps by mapping controls to keyboard keys for emulators that lack the ability to interface with the RetroPie controls (some of the standalone non-libretro cores and programs).

## To install please refer to the [Master Branch](https://github.com/CrashCortez/RetroMPV)
